# Iteration 001

- **Status:** planning

## Stories
- zaap-7xm: Xcode project scaffolding
- zaap-c6c: Location manager (significant location changes)
- zaap-t8f: Webhook client (POST with Bearer auth)
- zaap-x6c: Settings screen (URL, token, toggles)
- zaap-0a2: Background location delivery

## Guardrails
- Keep it minimal — get location tracking working end-to-end first
- No UI polish until core functionality is proven

## Notes
- Webhook endpoint already configured: `https://zanebot.tail66e5f8.ts.net/hooks/location`
- Gateway hooks mapping in place and tested
- iOS Shortcut proof-of-concept confirmed the webhook flow works
